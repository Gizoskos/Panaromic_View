# Panaromic_View

## Description  
Panaromic_View is a visual-analysis project developed to generate and explore panoramic views from multi-angle image sets. It enables users to compile images taken from different perspectives into seamless, wide-angle panoramas and perform exploratory operations such as zooming, panning and viewpoint switching.

## Features  
- Combine multiple images into a panoramic view with automatic alignment and blending  
- Seamless zoom and pan functionality for wide-angle visualization  
- Support for multiple input image perspectives and stitching into one unified frame  
- Export of final panoramas in standard image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG) for further use  

## Technologies & Tools Used  
- **Python** – Core scripting and image-processing logic  
- **OpenCV** – Image alignment, stitching and blending operations  
- **NumPy / SciPy** – Numerical operations and transformations  
- **Tkinter (or other GUI library)** – User interface for loading image sets and viewing results  
- **Git** – Version control and collaboration  
- **Optional: Docker / Virtual Environment** – Consistent runtime environment  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x installed  
- Required libraries installed via pip:  
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python numpy scipy
